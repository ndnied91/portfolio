                    Hello :)
                           <br/>
                           <br/>
                           My interest with web development began in 2016 after taking a trip to Appleâ€™s headquarters in Cupertino CA and envisioning ideas turning into full scale projects that anyone can enjoy. This one moment sparked an interest that I've been pursuing to this day.
                           <br/>
                           <br/>
                           Fast forward to 2021 I've recently graduated with a Computer Science degree with a GPA of 3.8 and have over 4 years of web development experience.
                           <br/>
                           <br/>
                           I love bringing my ideas to life using code. My passion lies with Full Stack Web Development using stacks such as ReactJS/NodeJS / MongoDB

                           <br/>
                           <br/>
                           These days Ive been expanding my knowledge by building new projects using languages such as Swift, React Native, GraphQL and TypeScript.
